### What Seb says

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to dive into NFL Analytics and started to follow
the big accounts (within the community) on Twitter.

I learned there was this R package [nflscrapR](https://twitter.com/nflscrapR) and
started to learn R and the NFL play-by-play data. Very quickly I got the urge 
to make some plots with R and post them on Twitter, because I wanted to hear 
what the people who know about it have to say. The plots were well received and 
I was getting requests to publish the related code. I did that and got a lot of 
positive feedback. 

At some point one thing led to another and before I knew it I developed 
[nflfastR](https://mrcaseb.github.io/nflfastR/) together with 
[Ben Baldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin). 
Most of my previously released code didn't work after that and I had to decide 
whether to just remove the code or rebuild the whole thing.

This website is the result but with a big improvement:
very intelligent people from the community agreed to publish their code as well. 
And this is the place where I want to centralize all these things.

### What Ben says

The existence of open-source packages like [nflscrapR](https://twitter.com/nflscrapR)
and [nflfastR](https://mrcaseb.github.io/nflfastR/) along with people's willingness 
to share code has made NFL analytics Twitter a great place to learn from each other. 
However, the nature of Twitter makes it hard to find old posts, and I often have 
a hard time remembering where I saw something. 

The hope is that this will serve as a resource for others.
